## Projects

### [Capstone Project 01: Variables and Control Structures](https://github.com/Anthorithm/finalCapstone/tree/main/01%20Capstone)

This script provides a simple financial calculator that allows users to calculate either the amount of interest they'll earn on an investment or the monthly repayment amount for a bond (home loan). It supports both simple and compound interest calculations for investments and provides accurate monthly bond repayment amounts based on user inputs.

### [Capstone Project 02:  Lists, Functions, and String Handling](https://github.com/Anthorithm/finalCapstone/tree/main/02%20Capstone)

This script implements a task management system that allows users to register new accounts, add tasks, view all tasks, view tasks assigned to them, generate reports, and display statistics. The script reads and writes user and task data to text files and provides a command-line interface for interacting with the system.
